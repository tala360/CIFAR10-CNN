# CIFAR10-CNN - DEEP LEARNING PROJECT
## Implementing different CNN models for multi-classification of the CIFAR-10 dataset.


In this multi-classification problem, we observe the CIFAR-10 dataset — a common dataset used in ma chine learning and computer vision — where there is a total of 60,000 images and 10 classes, with training data (X1 ,Y1 )...(X50,000 ,Y50,000 ) and testing data(X1 ,Y1 )...(X10,000 ,Y10,000 ) where X signifies a 32x32 RGB image, and Y denotes an integer label between 0-9 representing the following categories: ‘airplane’ → 0, ‘automobile’ → 1, ‘bird’ → 2, ‘cat’ → 3, ‘deer’ → 4, ‘dog’ → 5, ‘frog’ → 6, ‘horse’ → 7, ‘ship’ → 8, ‘truck’ → 9. A deep neural network is built, trained, and evaluated to predict the labels of the test images.
